# WooCommerce Connect

Although what you see today is a plugin, the goal for  WooCommerce Connect is to be a fully integrated part of WooCommerce core. To get us from feature plugin to core, WooCommerce Connect development is now in ALPHA - this means that you should expect frequent and sometimes large changes as features are added. During ALPHA testing, we'll be fixing problems and working to launch a feature-complete BETA. Successful BETA will culminate in a PR for inclusion into a future WooCommerce release.

**We do not recommend you use this ALPHA software on a production site.**

The emphasis for initial release of WooCommerce Connect is shipping simplified. We are providing a Shipping Zones-compatible USPS shipping method and, coming soon, a Shipping Zones compatible Canada Post shipping method. Shipping Zones are [an exciting new feature of WooCommerce 2.6](https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/02/10/shipping-zones-to-ship-with-2-6/).

Our USPS shipping method fetches rates for customers' carts in real time from the USPS server. No USPS account is needed - you can use the default one if you like.

There are many ways to contribute â€“ reporting bugs, feature suggestions, and fixing bugs. For full details, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Getting Started

* You'll need to have a WordPress site setup
* Install WooCommerce 2.6 [beta-1](https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/04/22/woocommerce-2-6-beta-1-is-here/) or [master](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce) and activate it
* Install [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/), activate it and connect it to your WordPress.com account

### Working with alpha

If you'd just like to checkout the latest alpha release and do not wish to contribute code back, then [download the latest release](https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-connect-client/releases) and install it as a plugin in your WordPress installation.

### Working with `master`

If you'd just like to checkout the latest code and/or wish to contribute code back, then do the following steps:

* Make sure you have `git`, `node`, and `npm` installed on the target machine/server. For maximum compatibility we recommend `node` version `5.11.1` and `npm` version 3+
* Clone this repository into the `plugins` folder of the WordPress installation.
* Run `npm install` to set up all the dependencies
* You now have two choices:
    * For Development: Add the following to your `wp-config.php` file: `define( 'WOOCOMMERCE_CONNECT_DEV_SERVER_URL', 'http://localhost:8085/' );` and then Run `npm start` which will start a webpack dev server at `localhost:8085`, complete with hot reloading whenever you make changes. You will need to keep the `npm start` task running while developing. You can press `ctrl+c` to exit this process.
    * For testing or pre-production use: Run `npm run dist` which will build the files into the `dist` folder, and will be loaded by the plugin without any additional configuration
