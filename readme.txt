Free real-time USPS and Canada Post rates and discounted USPS shipping labels for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Much of the power in WooCommerce lies in the ability to customize and add anything.

But with all that power comes great responsibility: to make it as simple as possible to do the basic things. Unfortunately, right now, doing basic things like adding a shipping option can be kind of complicated.

With Connect, we're simplifying shipping. In addition to supporting USPS and Canada Post real-time shipping rates in checkout, we've also made managing settings for those features to make them more user-friendly.

And we're very excited to announce that our flagship release of Connect doesn't just include real-time shipping rates but also includes discounted USPS shipping labels. Buy and print labels for all your domestic USPS shipping needs.
