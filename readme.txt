Hosted services for WooCommerce, including free real-time USPS and Canada Post rates and discounted USPS shipping labels. (BETA)

== Description ==

**This is a BETA release. Please carefully test and make sure it meets your needs before considering for a production site.**

Connect for WooCommerce makes basic eCommerce features like shipping more reliable by taking the burden off of your site’s infrastructure. 

With Connect, critical services are hosted on Automattic’s best-in-class infrastructure, rather than relying on your store’s hosting. That means your store will be more stable and faster.

To use the features, simply install this plugin and activate the ones you want directly in your dashboard. As we add more services, you’ll see more features available directly in WooCommerce - making setup simpler. 

*Show live rates for USPS and Canada Post*
Show your customers accurate shipping rates automatically for both USPS, the largest delivery network in the US, and Canada Post. 


*Print shipping labels for USPS at a discounted rate*
Give customers lower rates on their shipping. Create ready-to-print shipping labels for USPS directly in WooCommerce and take advantage of our special discount rate.
